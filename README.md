# Agentic AI Workflow for NLP, Vision, Audio & RLHF

## üîß Tech Stack
**Backend & Orchestration**: FastAPI, Apache Kafka, Docker, Kubernetes  
**LLMs & NLP**: LLaMA (Hugging Face), LangChain, LangGraph, CrewAI  
**Vector Store**: Weaviate  
**Vision**: GANs, Vision Transformers  
**Audio**: Whisper (ASR), Coqui TTS  
**RL**: RLHF (Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback)

## üß† Project Summary
A multimodal AI system with distributed microservices, integrating NLP, Computer Vision, and Audio processing pipelines. Agent workflows are coordinated using LangGraph and CrewAI. Uses event-driven communication via Kafka and incorporates RLHF and GANs for generative modeling and continuous learning.

---

## üîÅ Architecture
- **Microservices**: Decoupled services for each modality.
- **Communication**: Kafka topics for async inter-service communication.
- **Agent Coordination**: LangGraph + CrewAI agents for workflow management.
- **Data Storage**: Weaviate vector DB for semantic search and retrieval.

## üöÄ Functional Breakdown

### 1. **NLP Pipeline**
- Use LLaMA for QA, summarization, chat.
- LangChain for tool use and memory.
- Store document embeddings in Weaviate.

### 2. **Vision Module**
- OCR, classification, captioning.
- GANs for data augmentation & generation.

### 3. **Audio Pipeline**
- Whisper for ASR.
- Coqui TTS for spoken responses.

### 4. **RLHF Integration**
- Define rewards for good/bad agent responses.
- Fine-tune LLMs or agent policies.
- Use GANs to simulate RL environments when needed.
